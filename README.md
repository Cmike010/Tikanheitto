# Darts

React Native Expo project, schoolwork where I had to develop phone application to count results of darts competitions. 
User can decide to play regular finnish "MÃ¶kkitikka" or Darts 501. User can add results of each round and application
keeps track of the results and calculates winner.

## Techniques

Redux takes care of the global state management. Application saves data in to mobile device. Here, just for fun, I created a server as a part of 
project using express. Data is saved in to device in json-format.
